# _Pathfinding-with-A-Algorithm

Overview
This project implements the A (A-star) Pathfinding Algorithm* for finding the shortest path in a grid. It is commonly used in games and navigation systems to find optimal routes while avoiding obstacles.

Features
Grid-based Navigation: Works on a 2D grid where obstacles are represented by 1 and open spaces by 0.
Manhattan Distance: Uses Manhattan distance as the heuristic for pathfinding.
Optimal Path: Finds the shortest path from a start point to a goal point while avoiding obstacles.
